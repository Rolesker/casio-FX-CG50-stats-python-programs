# Chi-squared contingency tables
Calculates the chi-squared tables and statistics from a table of observed values in order to determine how likely it is that these variables are associated.

Enter the dimensions mxn of the observed data. Enter the observed values one by one, no need for adding totals. The rest will be done for you! the program will output each important piece of info seperately for the sake of copying it down:
- observed table with totals
- expected table of values
- wether or not there is any jepordising small data (<5)
- contingency table/contributing values
- chi-squared statistic
- degrees of freedom

# Spearman's rank correlation coefficient
Finds the degree of correlation between 2 variables.

Enter raw data, it will be ranked, then the rank coefficient will be outputted using the spearman's rank coefficient formula.
